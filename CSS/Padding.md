- Three important properties control the space that surrounds each HTML element: padding, margin, and border.

- An element's padding controls the amount of space between the element's content and its border.

- Here, we can see that the blue box and the red box are nested within the yellow box. Note that the red box has more padding than the blue box.

- When you increase the blue box's padding, it will increase the distance (padding) between the text and the border around it.
