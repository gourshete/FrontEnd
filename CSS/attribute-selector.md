You have been adding id or class attributes to elements that you wish to specifically style. These are known as ID and class selectors. There are other CSS Selectors you can use to select custom groups of elements to style,
which can be used by format `[attr=value]`

For example, the below code changes the margins of all elements with the attribute type and a corresponding value of radio:

`
[type='radio'] {
  margin: 20px 0px 20px 0px;
}
`
