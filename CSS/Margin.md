- An element's margin controls the amount of space between an element's border and surrounding elements.

- Here, we can see that the blue box and the red box are nested within the yellow box. Note that the red box has a bigger margin than the blue box.

- When you increase the blue box's margin, it will increase the distance between its border and surrounding elements.
